This program is used for my club activity. We hand out questionnaires to students to determine their personalities, and then group them together based on the similarities of their answers.

This program can read the data from Excel, then analyze and group the users using K-means.

Unzip the PenPalHunting.zip to get a folder called "Pen Pal Hunting." Open the PenPalHunting.jar, then a simple UI will pop out and you can start to use the program. The program will analyze the data in Book1.xls in the same folder.
